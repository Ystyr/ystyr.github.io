	<h1 class="sectionTitle">About</h1>	
	<div class="regular">	
		Welcome! My name is Alexey (Aleksei) Andreev, aka Ystyr. I'm living in Singapore (PR).
		This is my website created for shameless self-promotion. Nice to meet you. 
	</div> 
	<div class="regular left">

		I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in the game industry.<br>
		My skillset is a bit of everything, perhaps due to whether specifics of the industry or the explorative nature of myself. 
		Probably both.
	</div> 
	<div class="regular">
		So I have been developing production tools/pipelines, implementing different levels of the game logic, 
		game AI systems, rendering systems, VFX systems, postprocessing, procedural generators, audio system controllers, 
		GUI systems from scratch, system infrastructures, data flows, and other software architecture elements. 
		Even some management, hiring, and team building, but perhaps it wasn't my strongest side.
		Apart from that, I've implemented a lot of different API adaptations for different needs.	
	</div>
	<div class="regular left"> 
		There are things that I enjoy more, so I probably understand them deeper. 
		These are different rendering problems, mathematical optimization, general-purpose GPU programming, 
		aka "compute shaders", simulations and procedural generation. 
		Interested in machine learning researches, I've done some genetic algorithms, Markov chains etc.
	</div>
	<p class="regular">
		A significant part of my career was related to Kwest LLC, I've been doing a lot there.
		The main product was a location-based AR storytelling game - "Kwest Go". 
	</p>

	</p>
	<p class="regular">
		To illustrate my involvement; the CEO of Kwest, Omeed Shams used to say that the game wouldn't be even close to what it is without me, or maybe wouldn't be at all.
	</p>
	<p class="regular left">
		Some of the things I consider significant is: "Kwest Graph" - production toolset allowing to build the whole experience without programmers (although it wasn't perfect and we still had to always tweak and fix something here and there). 	
	</p>
	<p class="regular">
		Another thing, I can be proud of, is the map rendering system. We've been in partnership with Google and using their API called "MUSK". 
		The problem that it was creating tons of meshes for the map elements, the polycount was hundreds of thousands, and thousands of batches,
		So, I've developed an alternative rendering system to solve those problems, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pa7fW9eKvHGvYIE_18echDlDytfWwz0bzHk39RfSpY8/edit#">here are the details</a>
		Of course now I would do some parts of it differently and better...
	</p>
	<p class="regular">
		Unfortunately, the project didn't make it, when the Covid19 outbreak happened, location-based games become irrelevant, and we start to do many different things.
		Long story short, I have become a part of the subdivision: "Room 40 Games", have been doing many fast-cooked hyper-casual games. 
		There's one that I feel worth showing off, it was quite fun to make..

		Shortly thereafter this game failed hyper-casual marketing tests, I quit Kwest to start my new project under the code name: 
		"Krypto Creatures", it's about generative NFT entities and related infrastructure. 
		Involves AI, genetic programming, and blockchain technologies. 
		Unfortunately, I didn't have enough resources to continue to work on it full-time so it's now my little personal weekends work.

		Here's more of my little personal weekends works. 
		Shaders are an interesting way to demonstrate a high level of complexity (which I enjoy handling) and fascinating enough to attract your attention. 
		While I don't consider myself an artist, I enjoy creating such things in a form of mathematical and engineering problem-solving.
		Besides, you might be interested in the infrastructure I've developed for this showcase. Click on arrow icons to navigate.
